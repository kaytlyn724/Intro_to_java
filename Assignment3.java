1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

-- When working for an automotive company, I should think of ways to improve public life and safety rather than make more issues that could cause severe injury.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interest of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

-- When working for a client or employer I should not let my programming be used to harm another even if they are offering to pay more to do it.

3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible. 

-- Although I know an easier less efficient way to write a program for a company, I should give them my best work that they deserve to pay for.

6. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

-- When presenting a pitch to a company I should not come without an idea of what I'm presenting, and rather should be very prepared and dedicated to my work.

7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

-- If a peer or coworker does better on a project or in the workforce I should be supportive rather than jealous and work towards being just as successful.
